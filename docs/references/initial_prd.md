# Brazilian REH Analyzer - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Brazilian REH Analyzer
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: January 2025
**Status**: Development

### Executive Summary

The Brazilian REH Analyzer is a specialized econometric analysis tool designed to assess the rationality of Brazil's Focus Bulletin inflation forecasts according to the Rational Expectations Hypothesis (REH). This tool addresses a critical gap in Brazilian monetary policy research by providing automated, reproducible analysis of market expectations rationality.

### Problem Statement

Current analysis of Focus Bulletin forecast rationality requires:

- Understanding of Brazilian institutional context and data nuances

Existing tools lack:
- Brazilian-specific API integration
- Proper handling of Focus Bulletin data structure
- Academic-quality econometric testing
- Reproducible research workflows
